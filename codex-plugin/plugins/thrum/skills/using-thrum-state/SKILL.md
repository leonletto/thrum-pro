## Using Thrum State

### Overview

`thrum state` is a two-tier current-value store. **Agent-local** state
(`thrum state set/get/list/show/delete` with an undeclared or `personal_state`
kind) is your own standing status — reconcile it like your queue, at session
start and every breakpoint. **Fleet state** (deploy_state, topology, worktree,
agent_pool, ruling) is different in kind: it describes a fact about a DIFFERENT
machine that changes elsewhere, with no owner present when it goes stale.

**The governing invariant: a fleet row is a timestamped measurement, not a
current truth.** Every row carries `as_of`/`method`/`established_by` — read them
before you act.

### When to Use

- Checking your own agent-local current state at session start.
- Updating your own status/next-actions.
- Reading a fleet fact (deploy state, topology) before acting on it.
- Citing a SHA or box fact in a decision.
- Deciding whether a fleet row is fresh enough to trust.
- Responding to a freshness-sweep ping.
- Writing any fleet row (deploy state, topology, worktree, agent pool, or a
  standing ruling) — confirm you are writing from a by-effect measurement, not a
  guess, before you do.

### The named rot mode: "the tidied row"

A normalized or guessed value that reads byte-identically to a measured one.
This is how a coordinator acts on a confidently-wrong SHA. The corrected
intuition: **`as_of` is a measurement time, not a last-edit time** — writing a
fleet row without a fresh by-effect check, even to "fix" a value you believe is
stale, is exactly this failure.

### Reconcile, don't just read

- **Agent-local** (all roles): check at session start (`thrum state list`),
  update as you go. Carried-over state is NOT auto-injected into prime — you
  must ask.
- **Fleet** (coordinators write; everyone reads): before citing a fleet fact in
  a decision, check `as_of`/`method`. Past the kind's threshold
  (`thrum state describe <kind>`)? Re-verify by effect before acting, or say
  explicitly that you're acting on a stale value and why that's acceptable this
  once.

**Unmeasured ≠ measured-negative.** An absent row does not mean "at tip" or
"clean" — it means nobody has measured it. Do not read absence as a negative
result.

### Quick Reference

| Command                                                   | Effect                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `thrum state set --kind <k> --scope <s> --value '<json>'` | Upsert (create or overwrite)                    |
| `thrum state get <kind>:<scope>`                          | Read one entry                                  |
| `thrum state list [--kind <k>] [--agent <id>]`            | List entries                                    |
| `thrum state show <kind>:<scope>`                         | Full metadata for one entry                     |
| `thrum state delete <kind>:<scope>`                       | Remove outright (fleet: tombstones)             |
| `thrum state describe <kind>`                             | Dump a declared kind's field shape + threshold  |
| `thrum state history <kind>:<scope>`                      | Append-only write history (recovers LWW losers) |

`--method by_effect` when you measured it directly; `--method asserted` when
you're stating it without a live check; a write relayed from a message is forced
to `--method relayed` (low-trust) — never choose `relayed` yourself.

### Field Mutability Matrix

`Entry` (`internal/state/types.go`) has five mutability classes, not one uniform
"immutable field" guard:

- **immutable-identity** — part of the `(Kind, Scope)` addressing key, or fixed
  at creation with no update path. "Changing" one of these isn't an edit, it
  addresses a different record.
- **mutable-whole-object** — caller-settable via `state set`, which is always a
  full upsert (overwrite), never a field-level PATCH. Need a partial update?
  GET, edit client-side, SET the full value back.
- **mutable** — caller-settable via specific `state set` flags, independent of
  Value.
- **system-derived** — recomputed server-side from non-caller input (registry
  declaration, resolved caller identity); any caller-supplied value for these is
  ignored, not merely defaulted.
- **derived** — set only as an automatic side effect of a `state set` call,
  never independently caller-directed.

Changes only if the registry declaration itself changes.                                                                                    |

| `CreatedAt`      | immutable-identity (local tier only) | Stamped once at first insert                                                                                          | Local tier: preserved across updates by the store's rewrite path (`local_store.go` `Set`), not validated/rejected — it's simply never reassigned. Fleet tier: **not** independently preserved — there's no separate `created_at` column, so `fleet_store.go`'s `toEntry()` derives it from `UpdatedAt` on every read; do not assume local/fleet parity here. |
| `UpdatedAt`      | derived                              | Automatic side effect of every `state set`                                                                            | Never independently caller-directed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

None of this is a uniform "reject the write" guard (that mechanism —
`RejectIdentityKeysHandler` / `ErrImmutableField` — belongs to `thrum queue`, a
different subsystem, not state). State's actual enforcement is a mix: addressing
semantics for the identity fields (no error, just a different record), silent
wire-level drop for `Class`/`EstablishedBy` (no field to send them on), and
preserve-on-rewrite for local-tier `CreatedAt` (no validation, just never
overwritten).

### Common Flows

**Deploy runbook, after verifying a box's serving SHA:**

```bash
thrum state set --kind deploy_state --scope box-a \
  --value '{"serving_sha":"<sha>","schema":77}' --method by_effect
```

**Session-start reconcile (agent-local):**

```bash
thrum state list
# update anything stale; nothing auto-loads, so do this every session
```

**Responding to a freshness-sweep ping:** re-verify the named row by effect,
then `thrum state set` with the fresh value and `--method by_effect`. Never
"correct" a row you have not personally re-measured.

### Consolidating your agent-harness memories into state (durable overflow)

Your **agent-harness memories** — the memory index your runtime auto-loads at
session start (each runtime has its own: a `MEMORY.md`-style index on some, an
equivalent auto-injected file on Codex/Cursor/Copilot/others) — has a **load
size cap**. Past that cap the runtime **silently drops the tail entries** at
wake: they are invisible exactly when you most need them. Thrum state is an
uncapped, queryable durable store, so it is the right overflow home.

**Technique (scope-preserving — the only safe way to shrink the index):**

1. **Classify, don't cut.** For each auto-loaded entry ask: _if this were absent
   at wake, would I take a WRONG action, or merely a SLOWER one?_
   WRONG-if-absent (destructive-op guards, owner rulings, disbelieve-the-
   instrument traps, habits that must interrupt a confident wrong answer) STAY
   in the auto-loaded index. SLOWER-if-absent (things you would just look up
   once you know the topic exists) are demotable.
2. **Demote by MOVING, never by shortening.** Relocate each demotable entry
   **verbatim** into a thrum state entry (e.g.
   `thrum state set --kind reference --scope <agent>_discipline_index`) and/or
   your runtime's secondary lookup file. Leave a short **bidirectional
   pointer**: the auto-loaded index keeps a one-line pointer to the state entry;
   the state entry names the topic file the full detail lives in. **Never merge
   two entries, summarise to save bytes, or delete** — summarising discards the
   SCOPE that makes an entry true, which is the whole failure this guards
   against. The per-topic detail files are never touched.
3. **Reduction comes only from relocation.** Prove conservation:
   `entries_removed_from_index == entries_added_to_state` (set equality, not
   just count). Target comfortably under the load cap; do not chase a smaller
   number by demoting genuine must-fire entries.
4. **Use a high-reasoning subagent to index both stores** and PROPOSE the moves
   (it produces the new index, the state value, and a verification checklist);
   you review the judgment calls (which must-fire entries to keep) and apply.
   Watch for **line-packing collateral**: if two entries share one physical
   line, demoting one must not drag its line-mate out with it.
5. **Refuse the size-nag hook.** A `PostToolUse` hook may fire after an index
   edit demanding "compact / merge or drop stale entries." Merge and drop are
   forbidden by this contract; the sanctioned action is verbatim relocation,
   which you have already done. Being under the load cap is the goal, not the
   hook's smaller aspirational number.

### Common Mistakes

- **Normalising the deploy table to one SHA "because that's probably right."**
  This is the tidied-row catastrophe. Re-verify by effect or leave it
  stale-flagged.
- Writing the same fact to both agent-local AND fleet state (coordinators
  especially — see the coordinator preamble's anti-double-add rule).
- Choosing `--method relayed` yourself instead of letting a message-relay path
  force it.
- Treating an absent fleet row as a negative result instead of "nobody has
  measured this."
