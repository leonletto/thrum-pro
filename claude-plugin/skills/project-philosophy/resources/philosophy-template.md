# Implementation Philosophy

> **For all agents:** This document governs how features are built. Read this
> BEFORE any plan file or task descriptions. When in doubt, ask: "[your > >
> project's > guiding question — e.g., 'Am I wiring a real service, or faking >
>
> > it?']"
>
> **Fill this template** for your project. The pre-filled examples below are
> universal defaults — adapt, replace, or extend them for your domain.

## Core Principle

**Every implementation MUST satisfy ALL of these criteria:**

1. [Criterion 1 — e.g., Handler calls real service method, not hardcoded data]
2. [Criterion 2 — e.g., Template renders from service response, not inline HTML]
3. [Criterion 3 — e.g., Changing underlying data changes rendered output]
4. [Criterion 4 — e.g., Access control uses real permission checks, not
   client-side hiding]
5. The verification step in the task description passes

## Decision Framework

When implementing any requirement, follow this decision tree:

| Question                                   | Action                                |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Does a backend service already exist?      | Wire it. Do not rewrite.              |
| Does the service exist but need extension? | Extend the service, then wire.        |
| Is this purely new capability?             | Build minimal service first, then UI. |
| Is this seed data / configuration?         | Load into real stores, not hardcoded. |

## Anti-Patterns

<!-- Define BAD/GOOD code examples. Sections 1-3 are universal defaults.  -->
<!-- Sections 4+ are seeded from the reliability-class-library probe     -->
<!-- (project-philosophy SKILL.md Step 4a) — as many numbered sections as the probe finds, not a fixed count. -->
<!-- The BAD/GOOD format is critical — it makes the standard concrete and unambiguous. -->

### 1. Hardcoded data in handlers

```text
// BAD — handler returns static data, ignoring the service layer
func handleList(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    items := []Item{{Name: "hardcoded-1"}, {Name: "hardcoded-2"}}
    tmpl.Execute(w, items)
}

// GOOD — handler calls real service, renders response
func handleList(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    items, err := h.store.ListItems(r.Context())
    if err != nil { http.Error(w, err.Error(), 500); return }
    tmpl.Execute(w, items)
}
```

**Why:** Hardcoded data passes tests but breaks when real data changes. It
creates a false sense of completion.

### 2. Client-side permission hiding

```html
<!-- BAD — server renders everything, JS/CSS hides unauthorized items -->
<button id="admin-action" style="display:none">Delete</button>
<script>
  if (userRole === "admin") show("admin-action");
</script>

<!-- GOOD — server only renders items the user can access -->
{{if .Permissions.CanDelete}}
<button>Delete</button>
{{end}}
```

**Why:** Client-side hiding is a UI illusion, not access control. The server
still processes unauthorized requests.

### 3. Scripted/mocked responses in production paths

```python
# BAD — handler returns a pre-written response instead of calling the service
def analyze(request):
    return {"result": "This ticket appears to be high priority..."}

# GOOD — handler calls the real analysis service
def analyze(request):
    result = analysis_service.analyze(request.ticket_id)
    return {"result": result}
```

**Why:** Scripted responses mask integration failures. The service may not
actually work, and you won't know until production.

### 4. [Project-specific anti-pattern]

```text
// BAD
// GOOD
```

**Why:** [Impact explanation]

### 5. [Project-specific anti-pattern]

```text
// BAD
// GOOD
```

**Why:** [Impact explanation]

## Acceptable Simplifications

Not everything needs to be production-grade. These simplifications are OK:

| Simplification             | Why It's OK                          | Boundary (when to stop)                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| SQLite instead of Postgres | Same SQL interface, simpler setup    | When concurrent write throughput matters |
| Cached/mock external APIs  | Deterministic tests, no network deps | When testing real API behavior changes   |
| Static seed data           | Reproducible demos and tests         | When data must reflect real user input   |
| [Project-specific]         | [Rationale]                          | [Boundary]                               |

## Red Flags

If you see any of these in your code, **STOP and fix before continuing:**

- [ ] Literal data structures returned from handlers (not from a store/service)
- [ ] Inline HTML generation (`fmt.Fprintf`, string concatenation) instead of
      templates
- [ ] Missing error handling on service/store calls
- [ ] TODO/FIXME comments left in committed code
- [ ] [Project-specific red flag]
- [ ] [Project-specific red flag]
- [ ] [Project-specific red flag]

## For Implementation Agents

### Before You Start a Task

- [ ] Read the design doc referenced in your prompt
- [ ] Read the task description (`bd show {TASK_ID}`) — it's your source of
      truth
- [ ] Search the plan file for your task's implementation code
      (`grep "## Task: {BEAD_ID}" plan-file.md`)
- [ ] Identify which existing services to wire (do not reimplement)
- [ ] Review the anti-patterns above — know what NOT to do

### Before You Close a Task

- [ ] All acceptance criteria in the beads task are satisfied
- [ ] Tests pass (run quality commands from your prompt)
- [ ] No red flags present in your implementation
- [ ] Commit message is descriptive
- [ ] Code follows existing project patterns and conventions
