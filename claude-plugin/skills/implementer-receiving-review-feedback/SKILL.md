# Implementer: Receiving Review Feedback

This skill **complements** `superpowers:receiving-code-review` — it does not
restate the technical-rigor and no-performative-agreement content from that
skill. Layer the rules below on top of those universals.

## The review gate is a hard stop, not a suggestion

**Why:** Review gates exist because unreviewed code from one epic may require
substantial changes before the next epic can build on it. Starting the next epic
before the current one is reviewed creates compounding rework — when round-2
fixes land in epic N, the early work on epic N+1 may need to be redone or
reverted.

**How to apply:** After sending DONE/DONE_WITH_CONCERNS for an epic: close beads
tasks for that epic, ensure work is durably preserved per project policy, then
enter idle. Do not claim tasks in the next epic. Do not pre-read its spec
section. Do not "just start the trivial first task". Wait for the coordinator's
explicit GREENLIT or APPROVED message.

## Batch all review fixes into ONE commit

**Why:** A single fix commit makes re-review straightforward — the coordinator
inspects one diff against the numbered finding list. (In one case, an
implementer handled five findings in a single commit `<sha>`, which listed
each finding in the message body.) Per-finding commits multiply the surface
the re-review has to traverse
and increase the chance that a finding fixed in commit A is regressed by commit
B.

**How to apply:** Read the full numbered finding list before writing any code.
Fix all BLOCKING and IMPORTANT findings in scope. Run tests once they're all
addressed. Commit with a message that lists each finding number and its
resolution:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
fix: address review findings #1-#5 for <task-id>

- #1 (BLOCKING) — <one-line resolution>
- #2 (IMPORTANT) — <one-line resolution>
- #3 (LOW) — <one-line resolution>
- #4 (LOW) — verified false positive: <one-line evidence>
- #5 (LOW) — deferred per <decision/rationale>

make test PASS (race), make lint PASS.

Refs: <task-id>
EOF
)"
```

If a finding is truly independent and the coordinator explicitly requested
separate commits, that's the only time to fragment.

## Don't reflexively bucket findings as "follow-ups"

**Why:** When the file you're already modifying contains a small adjacent issue,
deferring it to a follow-up issue is often the wrong trade. The marginal cost of
fixing it now is small (the file is already in your context, you already
understand the surrounding code). The cost of a future follow-up is real
(re-load context, re-read neighbors, redo verification). Default to fix-now when
the file is already being touched. (Source: feedback_no_lazy_deferral.md.)

**How to apply:** For each finding categorized as "could defer", run the
trade-off explicitly:

- Is the file already in the diff? Default to fix-now
- Is the fix a few lines? Default to fix-now
- Does verification require running the same tests as the main fix? Default to
  fix-now
- Is the fix a meaningful refactor or design change? Defer is legitimate; file
  the bd issue and link it in the commit message

Don't reach for "deferred" as a shortcut to ship faster.

## Push back with file:line evidence when the reviewer is wrong

**Why:** Reviewers reading large diffs sometimes cite wrong line numbers,
describe behavior that doesn't match the current code, or apply a universal rule
to a project-specific exception. Pushback is welcome — it's how the feedback
loop stays calibrated. (Source: project Code Review Protocol —
"trace-corrections are welcome".) But pushback without verification is just
opinion against opinion.

**How to apply:** When you disagree with a finding, verify against the source
first:

- For file/line claims: read the cited file at the cited lines, paste the actual
  content
- For API claims: grep for the symbol, paste the signature
- For behavior claims: trace the call path and cite the relevant function

Format pushback as: "Finding #N — verified false positive. <one-line
restatement of what reviewer said>. Actual: <what the code does>, evidence at
`<file>:<line>`." Then ask the coordinator to drop or restate. If after
verification you're still convinced the finding is right, go fix it.

## Re-review after fixes — don't ship the round-2 fix as DONE on round 1

**Why:** When the coordinator dispatches re-review on the round-2 commit, they
expect to find a clean diff from your fix work. Accidentally bundling unrelated
changes into the fix commit muddies the review and either gets sent back or
merges work the coordinator hasn't seen.

**How to apply:** Between round-1 review feedback and round-2 ping:

1. Fix only what the findings ask for
2. Don't refactor, rename, or "improve" surrounding code
3. Verify tests pass with `-race`
4. Commit and ping with the per-finding disposition format from
   `implementer-status-and-handoff`

If you see additional issues during the fix work that weren't in the findings
list, file them as bd issues — don't slip them into the fix commit.

## Project-specific rules (already loaded)

Project-local rules of kind `agent_rule` at `--scope role` were loaded at
session start by your preamble (see your role template's Memory model block). If
a project-local rule conflicts with a universal rule above, the project-local
rule wins; surface the conflict in your reply so the user can decide whether to
graduate or remove the override.

If you accumulate a new rule mid-session (the user corrects you), capture it via
the `implementer-maintaining-memory` skill — it references the
`memory-write-discipline` common for the canonical `thrum memory create` shape.
