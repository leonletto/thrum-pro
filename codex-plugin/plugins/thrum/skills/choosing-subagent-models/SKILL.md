## Choosing Subagent Models

### Audit, review, or question? Require a file.

**Every subagent you dispatch for an answer must WRITE ITS RESULT TO A FILE
(e.g. `/tmp/<task>.md`); its reply to you is only a summary. Put this in the
prompt.**

### Pick a TIER by role/task, then resolve it for YOUR runtime. Pin every spawn.

Model selection here is two steps, always in this order:

1. **Pick the semantic tier** by the spawned agent's role/task — one of three,
   named identically everywhere in the fleet (Go constants, role templates, this
   doc): **`mechanical`** (rote/find-replace/grep-and-collect/lint/file-maps —
   the cheapest tier), **`judgment`** (the default tier for implementers,
   reviewers, verifiers, researchers — real analysis, not busywork), and
   **`orchestration`** (orchestrator/coordinator tier — never spawned for a
   sub-agent, only ever the operator's own agent or a skill that explicitly
   names it for one step).
2. **Resolve that tier to a concrete `model:` + `effort:` for the runtime you
   are actually running under** — via that runtime's own preset
   (`RuntimePreset.TierModels`) or operator config (`runtime.role_models`); see
   "Where the tier-model mapping lives" below. Never assume Claude's model names
   (`sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`) apply — a Codex or OpenCode agent reading this
   same file has no such models, and passing one either errors or silently falls
   back to the runtime's own default (see "Never let an unresolved pin fall
   through" below).

Every subagent you spawn MUST pass an explicit, resolved `model:` (plus effort
where the runtime supports it). Omitting it runs the subagent on YOUR model —
the single biggest avoidable cost leak in agent work.

Haiku 5.5 is eligible for summarization and mechanical work. Read the effective
model and effort at use from `runtime.role_models`.

#### Read the tiers at the moment of use

**Role templates and launch examples do not name models or effort levels; this
skill and the live config do.** Read the tier when you are about to spawn or
launch, never from memory or from a copied example:

```bash
jq -r '.runtime.role_models' .thrum/config.json
```

Launching with `--role` and no `--model` resolves the role default
automatically. A `--model` / `--effort` flag in a launch command takes its value
from `runtime.role_models` for the target role, per this skill.

#### Agent tiers

Effort tier governs whether an agent does the hard thing or the expedient thing.
These are the three tiers, with their Claude-runtime resolution shown as a
worked example — **if you are running under a different runtime, resolve the
same tier from your own runtime's preset (`RuntimePreset.TierModels`) or
`runtime.role_models`, not from the Claude column:**

| Role                                            | Tier            | Resolved for Claude (example) |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Orchestrator / coordinator**                  | `orchestration` | **`opus` / low**              |
| **Implementer**                                 | `judgment`      | **`sonnet` / medium**         |
| **Verifier / reviewer**                         | `judgment`      | **`sonnet` / medium**         |
| **Sub-agent** (investigation, grep, mechanical) | `mechanical`    | **`sonnet` / low**            |

- **`mechanical` tier (sub-agents ONLY)** — investigation, grep-and-collect,
  file maps, lint runs, mechanical tasks. Read the effective model and effort at
  use from `runtime.role_models`. For other runtimes, use their own
  mechanical-tier value (`RuntimePreset.TierModels`), not a Claude name. The
  mechanical tier is for sub-agents only, never for an implementer or a
  reviewer.
- **`judgment` tier (implementers, verifiers, reviewers)** — resolves to
  `sonnet` @ MEDIUM effort on Claude. Not low. A reviewer on low effort is a
  rubber stamp with extra steps, and rubber-stamped reviews are how a merge gate
  that ran zero tests survived six sessions.
- **`orchestration` tier (orchestrators/coordinators)** — resolves to `opus` @
  low on Claude. Not selectable for sub-agents — set by the operator on the
  agent's runtime-config.
- **`orchestration` tier is NOT your call to spawn.** Allowed only when (a) the
  operator explicitly asked for a deep review or prose review in this task, or
  (b) a skill you are running prescribes the orchestration tier for the specific
  step you are currently executing — NOT for every spawn under that skill. "This
  research is hard / important" is NOT a justification — hard investigation is
  exactly what the `judgment` tier is for.

### Worked examples — LITERAL ARGUMENTS, AND EFFORT IS TOOL-DEPENDENT

**Pin `model` on every spawn, using the value your runtime's own preset
(`RuntimePreset.TierModels`) or `runtime.role_models` resolves the tier to.**
**Pass `effort` wherever the mechanism exposes it** — some mechanisms don't.
Syntax per mechanism — re-check the schema in front of you rather than restating
from memory, because it can change:

| Mechanism                                                                                | `model`      | `effort`                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Agent tool**                                                                           | ✅ settable  | ✖ **not exposed — do not pass it**        |
| **Workflow `agent()`** (opts: label, phase, schema, model, effort, isolation, agentType) | ✅ settable  | ✅ settable                               |
| **Agent DEFINITION** (`.claude/agents/*.md` / plugin `agents/*.md` frontmatter)          | ✅           | ✅ — sets the default for that agent type |
| **`thrum tmux create` / `launch`**                                                       | ✅ `--model` | ✅ `--effort` — pass on BOTH              |
| **Other runtimes' own spawn mechanism**                                                  | ✅ settable  | runtime-dependent — check its own schema  |

**Below is ONE fully concrete example — what a `judgment`-tier spawn looks like
once resolved for Claude's own Agent tool (which takes no `effort` argument).**
It is Claude-specific syntax with a Claude-specific model string; if you are
running under a different runtime, use that runtime's own spawn mechanism and
its own resolved model+effort from `RuntimePreset.TierModels` /
`runtime.role_models` instead of copying this literal string.

```python
Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose", model="sonnet",
      description="Code-quality review of <branch>",
      prompt="...")
```

**The tier philosophy still governs even where a mechanism cannot express
`effort`:** the `model` value alone still must be the tier's resolved value for
YOUR runtime — never a bare Claude name assumed universal. Where effort is not
settable, carry the intent through the agent definition, the Workflow opts, or
the tmux launch flags instead.

An agent definition can also carry a default (Claude example — resolve to your
own runtime's `mechanical`-tier value if you are not Claude):

```yaml
# claude-plugin/agents/message-listener.md (non-tmux fallback only)
name: message-listener
model: sonnet
effort: low
```

**Workflow `agent()` — effort IS a literal argument. Pass it, resolved for your
runtime's tier:**

```javascript
agent(prompt, { model, effort }); // `model`/`effort` = your runtime's resolution
// of the `judgment` tier (reviewer/implementer)
// or the `mechanical` tier (sub-agent) —
// resolve via RuntimePreset.TierModels /
// runtime.role_models for the literal values
```

**THE DIRECTIVE, imperative and not a comment: REVIEWERS RUN THE `judgment`
TIER, WHICH IS MEDIUM EFFORT ON EVERY RUNTIME THAT HAS AN EFFORT KNOB.** Pass
the resolved effort literally under Workflow, in the agent definition, or on
`thrum tmux create`/`launch` (the Agent tool takes no `effort`, so `model` alone
must still be the `judgment`-tier value there). Never dispatch a reviewer "from
memory", and never dispatch one at the mechanical tier.

**AND VERIFY, DO NOT ASSERT:** any claim about what a tool does or does not
expose must be checked against the schema in front of you.

Never select the `orchestration` tier on your own judgment — use the `judgment`
tier's configured value from `runtime.role_models`.

### Where the tier-model mapping lives

**Do not copy a tier's model string from this doc — read it at the moment of
use.** The three semantic tiers (`mechanical` / `judgment` / `orchestration`)
are the same across every runtime; only the concrete model+effort differs per
runtime, and that mapping lives in exactly two places:

- **The runtime's own preset** (the `TierModels` field of the runtime preset
  schema) — the machine-checked, per-runtime tier→model table. A runtime with no
  entry for a tier has no fleet-configured value for it and resolves to nothing
  rather than inheriting another runtime's model.
- **`runtime.role_models` in `.thrum/config.json`** — operator configuration for
  this project, which always outranks the preset's tier table.

**If you are running under Claude**, use the Agent tiers table above
(orchestrator/implementer/reviewer/sub-agent → orchestration/judgment/
judgment/mechanical), plus brainstormer → `orchestration` and brainstormer's own
subagents → `mechanical` (except reviewers, which are always `judgment`).

**If you are running under a different runtime, read your own tier's value from
the two sources above** — never assume Claude's model names apply, and never
hard-code a model string you saw once in a doc or a prior session.

A runtime/role pair with no fleet-configured tier value has no override —
resolve it to that runtime's own configured default, and pass it explicitly
(never leave it unset — see "Never let an unresolved pin fall through" below).

### Pin every spawn explicitly — the floor depends on the ROLE, not the depth

Every orchestrator MUST pass an explicit `model:` on EVERY subagent it spawns,
resolved for its own runtime, and `effort` wherever the mechanism exposes it. An
unspecified subagent SILENTLY INHERITS THE PARENT'S MODEL — so an
orchestration-tier orchestrator that forgets the pin just spent its (expensive)
tier's tokens on a grep.

**The floor is set by what the agent DOES, not by how deep it sits** — see the
Agent tiers table above. This applies recursively: an implementer spawning its
own helpers pins them by THEIR role, not by copying its own tier down.

The check before every spawn: what is this agent's ROLE? Reviewer or
implementer? `judgment` tier. Pure investigation or mechanical work?
`mechanical` tier. Then resolve that tier to your runtime's concrete
model+effort. Never leave it unspecified.

#### Never let an unresolved pin fall through

**An unsupported or unrecognized model name must never block delegation, and
must never cause silent inheritance of the parent's model.** If your runtime's
preset has no `TierModels` entry for this tier, or a resolved name is rejected
by the runtime you're spawning under, do NOT skip the pin and do NOT let the
spawn go unpinned so it falls back to inheriting the caller's model — fall back
explicitly to the runtime's own configured default for the matching tier and
pass THAT, so every spawn is always pinned to some resolved model+effort. An
unset `model:` is a bug at every layer of this stack, not just under Claude.

### Paste the constraint block into the child prompt — the pin is not enough

**A model pin is an ARGUMENT and travels by itself. A behavioural constraint is
PROSE and reaches the child only if you paste it.** Constrain every level: a
rule that stops at depth 1 is absent where the work happens.

**Paste verbatim, including the last line:**

```text
=== CONSTRAINTS — apply to you and anything YOU dispatch (including this line) ===
- Work SYNCHRONOUSLY. Tests in the FOREGROUND with a bounded `-timeout`.
- NO POLL LOOPS. Never `until <check>; do sleep N; done`, never
  `while kill -0 $(cat pid)`, never `$( )` in a loop condition — even when a
  tool's own guidance suggests it. It trips a permission modal, and A FROZEN
  PANE EMITS NOTHING, so nobody can tell you are blocked. If you must background
  work, wait for the completion notification.
- Every sub-agent YOU spawn gets an explicit `model:`, resolved for your
  runtime's tier — `mechanical` (rote/find-replace) or `judgment` (real
  analysis). Read the effective model and effort from `runtime.role_models` at
  use. The `orchestration` tier is never yours to spawn.
- READ-ONLY git outside your own worktree. NEVER `checkout`/`reset`/`restore`/
  `stash`/`clean` in ANY directory — `stash` is one shared stack across all
  worktrees and the shared tree holds live agents' uncommitted state.
- Pair every zero/empty result with a control that MUST return non-zero.
```

⚠️ Never let a child take **"don't ask again"** on a modal — it removes the only
signal this condition produces.

#### Cheap subagents → fan out, don't pile up

Because Haiku 5.5 supports summarization and mechanical sub-agent work, prefer
MANY small parallel subagents over one agent handed a pile of tasks. Read the
effective model and effort from `runtime.role_models` at dispatch. When research
or investigation has independent parts, partition them in parallel (use the
`efficient-multi-agent-research` skill) — smaller scopes are cheaper, run
concurrently (faster), and keep each subagent's context tight. One subagent
given ten tasks is the anti-pattern.

### ⚠️ The pin-verification command LIES — do not trust it

**This section's examples are Claude-specific** (`thrum tmux capture`'s footer
format, and the historical Sonnet/Opus incident it documents) because that is
where this defect was measured — but the underlying rule generalizes: verify a
pin by reading the runtime's own RESOLVED status output, never a stored
"configured" value, whichever runtime you're on.

`thrum agent runtime-config get <agent>` reports the **configured** value, not
the **resolved** one.

An implementer ran Opus 4.8 while both the launch flag (`--model sonnet`) and
`runtime-config get` confirmed sonnet — the check that exists to catch a bad pin
is itself a false green.

This is the same defect class as every other surface that reports a value it
never observed (`go test -count=0` reporting PASS while running zero tests; a
health RPC reporting green off a path that cannot fail; `make ci` swallowing a
critical CVE with a warning).

**So: after launching an agent, verify with
`thrum tmux capture --format=annotated` (or `--format=json` for scripting).** It
parses the footer server-side into NBSP-free fields — no positional-window
guessing, no NBSP grep trap, and the header states `ok`/`FAILED` explicitly
instead of leaving you to infer a failure from empty stdout:

```bash
thrum tmux capture <agent-name> --format=annotated --lines 12
# ━━━ CAPTURE ok · agent=<name> · runtime=claude · lines=35 ━━━
# <pane content, verbatim>
# ─── FOOTER (parsed, NBSP-normalized) ───
# Model: Sonnet 5 | Ctx: 478.3k | Ctx Used: 48.0%
# ━━━ END CAPTURE ━━━
```

The FOOTER block is simply omitted when no footer resolved — never an empty or
garbage line to misread. For scripting, `--format=json` gives the same data as a
typed document:
`{"agent","runtime","ok","line_count","footer":{"model","ctx","ctx_used_pct"}|null,"lines":[...]["error"]}`
(`footer` is `null` when none resolved).

```bash
thrum tmux capture <agent-name> --format=json | python3 -c \
  'import json,sys; b=json.load(sys.stdin); print(b["footer"]["model"] if b["footer"] else "NO FOOTER")'
```

Still check the exit status before trusting either form — a FAILED capture exits
nonzero and the annotated header says `FAILED`, but don't discard that signal by
piping straight into something that only inspects stdout.

That is the runtime reporting its RESOLVED config, and it is the only check that
has ever produced a true negative on this defect. If it disagrees with the pin,
report it — those instances are a real bug and we want them counted.

🔴 **DO NOT substitute "ask the agent what model it is running."** That is a
model introspecting on its own identity — a categorically weaker instrument. **A
check built on self-report would be a THIRD instrument that cannot fail in the
direction we need**, replacing a false green with a confident one. **SETTLED —
and the reason is categorical, not a reliability judgement: self-report is the
WRONG SHAPE for the question.** The agent sees exactly ONE value (its resolved
model, injected into its own system prompt); "does the pin disagree with the
resolution?" is a question about a RELATION between TWO values. **It cannot
report a mismatch however honest it is — the disagreement is not representable
in what it can observe.** No prompting rescues that. Only an outside comparator
holding BOTH the pin AND the resolved status line answers it. ⚠️ A self-report
can look right while reading back an injected assertion, so it inherits whatever
the injection got right or wrong. **A correct answer there is survivorship, not
validation.**

**Fallback — only if `--format` is unavailable (older binary):** read the bare
exit status before stdout, then grep the raw pane by position, never by content
(the raw footer's separators are U+00A0 non-breaking spaces, so `grep "Model: "`
with a trailing space returns ZERO on a pane that plainly displays a model):

```bash
out=$(thrum tmux capture <agent-name> --lines 12); rc=$?   # bare, NOT through a pipe
[ $rc -ne 0 ] && echo "CAPTURE FAILED — this is NOT an empty pane" && exit 1
printf '%s\n' "$out" | grep -v 'tmux capture' | grep 'Model:' | tail -1
```

🔴 **PASS `--model` / `--effort` TO BOTH `tmux create` AND `tmux launch`.** They
are separate cobra commands with separate flags, and **`launch` is what resolves
the model** (`resolveLaunchSpec` runs in `HandleLaunch`, never in create).
`create` persists the pin asynchronously, so a create-only pin can lose the race
and leave the CLI value empty at launch **by construction**.

⚠️ **And any FIX here must be verified with a pin the role default would NOT
produce.** An implementer pinned to sonnet, with an implementer role-default of
sonnet, comes up correct whether or not the pin landed — so "pin sonnet, confirm
sonnet" passes whether or not the fix works.

### Paste blocks for child prompts

Paste these verbatim into a child prompt when the work involves the named
activity.

--- SUB-AGENT HYGIENE ---

- No kill -0, Monitor or until-loop polling.
- No pgrep -f.
- Kill only by a captured PID number.
- Use rm -r, never rm -rf; a variable path uses "${d:?}".
- No 2>/dev/null on destructive commands.
- Bounded timeouts on everything.
- Remove only the worktree you created in this task, by its recorded path, never
  with --force.
- Never demonstrate an unguarded destructive idiom, even on a literal path. ---
  END SUB-AGENT HYGIENE ---

--- TESTS ---

- To prove a selector resolves, use `go test <pkg> -list '<selector>'` plus a
  `-list '^TestNoSuchThingAtAll$'` negative control that must list zero tests.
  Never `-run '<sel>' -list '.*'`.
- `bd list -l` is --label; use `-n` for a limit.
- A timeout with 0 FAIL is neither red nor green: classify it as a bound
  failure, read the panic's "running tests:" line, and re-run wider. --- END
  TESTS ---

--- WORKTREE TEARDOWN & SALVAGE ---

- Before any teardown, enumerate with both flags:
  `git -C <wt> status --porcelain --untracked-files=all --ignored -- .thrum`.
- Salvage anything found to a durable path (not /tmp), one subdirectory per
  worktree, filenames path-flattened.
- Never glob `.thrum/context/*.md`; salvage the exact agent-name file only, and
  assert no `project_state.md` landed in any salvage output.
- Verify salvage by name set first, then `cmp` each file, with a negative
  control proving `cmp` detects a difference.
- Kill the tmux session first (`thrum tmux kill <session>`), verify it is gone,
  then plain `git worktree remove`, never `--force`.
- Afterwards verify by effect: gone from `git worktree list` and from disk, and
  every remaining live pane's cwd still resolves
  (`tmux list-panes -a -F '#{pane_current_path}'`, then
  `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` per pane).
- Build the in-use protection set from live pane cwds, not from a name or
  registry list.
- Report the removal count and the registry delta separately. --- END WORKTREE
