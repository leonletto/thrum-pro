# Thrum: Update Agent State

Record the just-completed session into `.thrum/agents/<agent-id>/state.md` so
the NEXT wake's `/thrum:prime-agent` invocation has continuity.

This skill is the wake-loop counterpart to `/thrum:prime-agent`. Run this at the
END of every scheduled-agent session, before exiting.

## When to use this skill

- You're a SCHEDULED AGENT (woken by an `agent.wake` message)
- You're about to exit / end the session
- You have a coherent one-line summary of what shipped

If you're an operator-spawned agent (coordinator, on-demand task), use
`/thrum:update-project` instead — that updates the project- wide state.md, not
the per-agent state.md this skill targets.

## Verify before you write

A state.md fact is TRUE when written and can silently become FALSE later —
the reader can't tell, because a summary doesn't present itself as a
time-bound claim (thrum-hrigx: three agents burned by their own durable
artifacts in one night). Only summarize what you've verified against current
state, not what you remember or assume. If your summary or narrative fields
record an UNEXPLAINED artifact, carry the unexplained-ness forward — "not
mine, cause unknown, nobody has traced this" — rather than resolving it to a
disposition like "ignore it." "Ignore it" is unfalsifiable by construction
(an instruction to not look can't be caught by looking) and can silently
train the next wake to stop looking at the one visible symptom of a live bug.

## Step 1: Compose your one-line summary

Write a single sentence that names what shipped this session. Examples (drawn
from prior session-archive epic's §1 mandate, same specificity standard):

> Locked the session-archive spec v2 with §1 Big picture requirement, five
> Q-Spec approvals, and Q-Spec-5 deferred to impl-time.
>
> Closed B-B1 E6.0 brainstormer-third pass. 2 BLOCKING + 5 IMPORTANT + 10 MINOR.
> All three load-bearing traps PASSed.
>
> Investigated rc.9 inbox-race; confirmed lock-substrate fence is the right fix.
> Filed thrum-XXX with 4 BLOCKING evidence points.

Be specific. Future-you skimming the verbatim queue will skim these one-liners
first — vague entries ("worked on B-B1") waste the verbatim slot.

## Step 2: Run the update command

```bash
SESSION_ID=$(thrum whoami --field session_id)
thrum agent state update \
  --session-id "${SESSION_ID}" \
  --summary "<your one-line summary from Step 1>"
```

The CLI:

1. Reads `.thrum/agents/<your-agent-id>/state.md` (or creates an empty one on
   first wake).
2. Prepends your new entry to the verbatim queue (slot #1).
3. Promotes the displaced #4 entry into the most-recent summary block (per spec
   §7.5 sliding-window rules), opening a new block + dropping the oldest if the
   cap is reached.
4. Writes the updated `state.md` atomically (temp-file + rename).

The strict 4-verbatim / 3-block / 5-per-block invariants live in the
`internal/agentstate` package, invoked by this CLI command — not by the
daemon. Enforcement only fires when you actually run `thrum agent state
update`; nothing watches or rewrites the file in the background. You can't
accidentally break the format by running this command, but hand-editing
`state.md` yourself is NOT supported (the parser will reject a manually-
mangled file at the next recovery cycle) and does not go through this
enforcement at all.

## Step 3: Optional — replace narrative sections

If this session changed your "Last worked on" or "Planning next" paragraphs
(e.g., closed an open thread, identified a new follow-up), pass them as flags:

```bash
thrum agent state update \
  --session-id "${SESSION_ID}" \
  --summary "<one-liner>" \
  --last-worked-on "I closed E6.2 update-state. Open thread: recovery skill needs the RouteEscalation wiring (Task 26)." \
  --planning-next "Next wake should pick up Task 26 — the parse-validation pre-condition is the load-bearing piece per spec §6.5."
```

Without these flags, the previous "Last worked on" / "Planning next" paragraphs
are preserved. Skill `/thrum:prime-agent` will surface them on next wake
regardless.

## Step 4: Verify the write

The CLI prints a one-line confirmation:

```text
Updated /path/to/.thrum/agents/<id>/state.md (verbatim: N, summary blocks: M)
```

Where N ∈ [1, 4] and M ∈ [0, 3]. If N or M fall outside those ranges, something
is wrong — the format invariants are enforced in code; an out-of-range count
indicates a code bug worth filing under thrum-xir.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does NOT update `last_seen_skills.txt` (that's `/thrum:update-agent-state`'s
  sibling responsibility, wired by Task 27 of B-B1 E6.2; current implementation
  does not bump the file).
- Does NOT trigger the next wake (cron / scheduler dispatch is daemon-driven;
  this skill just records what already shipped).
- Does NOT recover from a malformed `state.md` — if the parser rejects the
  existing file, run `/thrum:recover-agent-state` first to clear the corruption
  flag via the spec §6.5 flow.
