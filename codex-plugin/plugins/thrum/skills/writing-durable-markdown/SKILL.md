## Writing or editing ANY markdown file — state the rule and stop

Not what was done. Not why it was wrong. Not what the previous version said. Not
what not to do. Not the incident. **Just the rule, in the imperative.**

### Before you save: measure

```bash
git diff --numstat -- <file>
```

**More than ~5 added lines for one rule means you wrote a story.** Cut it.

### The three costs

**1. Tokens, paid at every wake, by everyone.** `CLAUDE.md`, role preambles and
state files are injected into every agent's context at every wake. A 40-line
explanation is not paid once by the author — it is paid by every agent, every
session, forever. Inside a session it is worse than linear: injected text is
re-read on every later turn.

**2. Contradiction.** Stories assert facts. Three stories about one rule
disagree about its scope, whether it still applies, and which version is
current. **An agent cannot tell which sentence is authoritative, so it obeys
both.** Prose rots silently — a test goes red when it drifts, a paragraph never
does.

**3. Abandonment.** Past a certain size nobody can audit the file for
contradictions, so nobody tries, and the contradictions become permanent. **The
bloat is what makes the file unfixable** — every story added removes someone's
ability to fix the story before it.

### A correction replaces; it does not accumulate

Delete the wrong text and write the right rule in its place. A correction left
_beside_ what it corrects leaves two claims and no way to rank them. Corrections
are always longer than what they replace, so this is the main way these files
grow.

### Where the story goes

`thrum memory` — retrieved on demand by the agent who needs it, instead of
injected into everyone. Keep the rule in the doc; leave at most a one-line
pointer.

### Exempt from the cap

Tables, CLI output, command strings, file paths, enumerated vocabularies.
**Never truncate those to hit a line count.** The cap stops narrative; it does
not shorten data.

### Shipped content carries no internal particulars

No issue IDs, no dates, no agent names, no measurements in customer-facing
files. The tracker references the change; the change never references the
tracker.
