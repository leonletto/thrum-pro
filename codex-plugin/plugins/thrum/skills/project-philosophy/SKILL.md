## Project Philosophy

### Canonical path

`.thrum/philosophy.md` — the single authoritative location. `project-setup` and
every implementation-agent prompt read from this path only. Non-standard paths
are handled by the fallback migration (documented below), not by moving the
canonical target.

### Run modes and dispatch order

On every invocation, dispatch in this order. Earlier branches short-circuit
later ones.

0. **Fallback migration** — runs first when `.thrum/philosophy.md` is absent. If
   a legacy philosophy doc exists elsewhere in the repo, offer move/link/fresh
   before generating anything new. If no legacy doc is found, fall through to
   branch 1.
1. **First-run** (doc absent, no legacy doc or "fresh" chosen above) — generate
   a new `.thrum/philosophy.md` from project inspection + interactive prompts
   (documented below).
2. **Re-run-unchanged** (doc present, matches current project state) — report
   "philosophy.md is current; no changes needed" and exit without writing.
3. **Re-run-evolved** (doc present, project has drifted) — compute a sectional
   diff, present via `AskUserQuestion`, write only on confirmation.

The modes are idempotent — running the skill repeatedly on a stable project
should produce no file changes after the first run.

> **Note: human-in-the-loop required.** This skill uses `AskUserQuestion` for
> first-run project-specific prompts, re-run-evolved diff approval, and
> fallback-migration three-way choice. It cannot run unattended in CI or any
> other non-interactive automation context. Invoke it only from a session that
> can answer prompts.

### Fallback migration

Runs before the First-run branch when `.thrum/philosophy.md` is absent. If the
user has a philosophy doc at a legacy path, offer a three-way choice rather than
ignoring it and generating a parallel doc.

#### Step 1: Search for legacy philosophy docs

```bash
find . -type f \( -name "*philosophy*" -o -name "*anti-pattern*" -o -name "*implementation-standards*" -o -name "CONTRIBUTING.md" \) \
  -not -path '*/node_modules/*' \
  -not -path '*/.git/*' \
  -not -path '*/dist/*' \
  -not -path '*/build/*' \
  2>/dev/null | head
```

Common legacy locations: `dev-docs/implementation-philosophy.md`,
`docs/anti-patterns.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` with an anti-patterns section.

If zero candidates: fall through to First-run. If one or more candidates:
present the choice.

#### Step 2: Present three-way choice via `AskUserQuestion`

Question: "Found existing philosophy doc at `<path>`. What should I do?"

Options:

- **Move** — `git mv <path> .thrum/philosophy.md`. Preserves history via rename;
  the file moves to the canonical location and the legacy path stops existing.
- **Link** — Create `.thrum/philosophy.md` with a single line: `See: <path>`.
  The legacy doc stays in place; the canonical path becomes a pointer. Useful
  when the legacy path is load-bearing (e.g., referenced from a
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` that can't be retargeted cheaply).
- **Fresh** — Ignore the legacy doc; generate a new `.thrum/philosophy.md` via
  the First-run flow. The legacy doc stays unmodified. Useful when the legacy
  doc is stale or incomplete.

If multiple candidates were found, ask which one first (separate
`AskUserQuestion`) before offering move/link/fresh.

#### Step 3: Execute the chosen option

**Move path:**

```bash
mkdir -p .thrum/
git mv <legacy-path> .thrum/philosophy.md
```

`git mv` requires the repo to be initialized with at least one commit on the
current branch. If the repo has no commits (fresh `git init`), fall back to a
plain `mv` + `git add`, and note in the final message that rename history is not
preserved.

**Link path:**

```bash
mkdir -p .thrum/
printf 'See: %s\n' "<legacy-path>" > .thrum/philosophy.md
```

**Fresh path:** Drop into First-run mode without touching the legacy file.

#### Step 4: Announce and continue

Tell the user what was done and where the canonical doc now lives. If `move` or
`link` was chosen, exit (the doc is materialized — no further generation
needed). If `fresh` was chosen, continue into First-run Step 1.

### First-run mode

Triggered when `.thrum/philosophy.md` does not exist AND no non-standard
philosophy doc is found (or the fallback migration is skipped via the "fresh"
option).

#### Step 1: Detect language

Inspect the repo root for manifest files and pick the primary language:

| File present                                         | Language                |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `go.mod`                                             | Go                      |
| `package.json`                                       | JavaScript / TypeScript |
| `Cargo.toml`                                         | Rust                    |
| `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py` or `requirements.txt` | Python                  |
| `pom.xml` or `build.gradle*`                         | Java / Kotlin           |
| `Gemfile`                                            | Ruby                    |
| `mix.exs`                                            | Elixir                  |

If multiple are present, record the repo as polyglot and pick the most prominent
by file count.

#### Step 2: Detect framework

Grep the detected language's manifest for well-known framework markers:

- Go: `cmd/` layout + `net/http` or `gin-gonic` or `chi` → web service; `cobra`
  → CLI; pure library if neither
- JS/TS: `next` in `package.json` → Next.js; `react` without Next → React SPA;
  `express`/`fastify` → Node backend
- Python: `fastapi`/`flask`/`django` in dependencies → web backend;
  `pytorch`/`tensorflow` → ML
- Rust: `tokio`/`actix-web`/`axum` → async service; bin-only → CLI

#### Step 3: Detect test harness

Check for test files and harness config:

- Go: `*_test.go` files; `testing` package import → stdlib; `testify` →
  assertions; `ginkgo` → BDD
- JS/TS: `__tests__/` or `*.test.ts`; `jest.config.*`, `vitest.config.*`,
  `playwright.config.*`
- Python: `tests/` dir; `pytest.ini`, `conftest.py`
- Rust: `#[cfg(test)]` blocks; `cargo test` always available

Record the harness in the rendered template so implementation-agent prompts know
how to run tests.

#### Step 4: Detect pattern conventions visible in existing code

Sample the codebase for:

- Error handling shape (Go: `if err != nil { return ..., fmt.Errorf(...) }`;
  Rust: `?` propagation; TS: try/catch vs. Result types)
- Logging convention (structured vs. `fmt.Println`; named logger vs.
  package-level)
- Public API shape (exported types, interface-heavy vs. struct-heavy)

Grep narrow — 20–50 lines is enough to surface the dominant convention. Don't
read the whole repo; surface what's consistent, let the user correct via
prompts.

#### Step 4a: Probe for generalizable reliability classes

Read `resources/reliability-class-library.md`. For each of its 7 classes, run
the per-language probe matching the language detected in Step 1 (fall back to
the class's generic probe if the detected language has no dedicated entry).
Record every hit as an adapted finding: the class name, the specific file/line
found, and a BAD/GOOD pair phrased in the target repo's own language and idioms
— never reuse the library's own example snippets verbatim, they are
illustrations of the SHAPE to look for, not text to paste.

A class with zero hits is not an error — record it as walked-and-not-found and
move on. This step runs before the interactive prompts (Step 5) so seeded
findings can be shown to the user as defaults they can accept, edit, or decline,
rather than starting from a blank prompt.

#### Step 5: Interactive prompts for project-specific rules

Use `AskUserQuestion` for items the codebase can't reveal:

- Known anti-patterns this team has hit (with links to post-mortems if any)
- Non-negotiable red flags (e.g. "never rm -rf a session dir")
- Deploy/release constraints (e.g. "no pushes to main from agents")
- External dependencies that require care (e.g. "never call prod Salesforce APIs
  from tests")

Each prompt should offer a clear default (usually "none"). Philosophy doc
quality comes from real answers, not filler.

> **`AskUserQuestion` permits at most 4 options per question.** Exceeding the
> limit triggers a runtime "Invalid tool parameters" / "expected array to have
> <=4 items" error. Each of the categories above has a natural option count that
> can grow past 4 once a real team's rules are listed — so use multiple
> sequential questions (e.g. "category?" → "specific item within category?")
> rather than packing options into a single prompt. Prefer one prompt per
> category over one prompt with all categories listed.

#### Step 6: Render the template

Read `resources/philosophy-template.md`. It is not token-substituted — it uses
bracketed prose placeholders (e.g. `[Criterion 1 — e.g., ...]`) that you replace
with real content, and `<!-- TODO: ... -->` comments for anything left
undetected or unprovided. Fill in:

- The intro/language/framework/test-harness lines from Step 1–3.
- The `## Anti-Patterns` section's `### 1.`–`### 3.` entries are universal
  defaults — leave them as-is unless a detected convention (Step 4) contradicts
  one.
- `### 4.` onward: one numbered section per Step 4a finding (an adapted class
  hit), in the order the classes are listed in the library, using that finding's
  BAD/GOOD pair and Why. If Step 4a found more than 2 classes, add as many
  numbered sections as the probe finds — the template's `### 4.`/ `### 5.` are
  illustrative slots, not a fixed count. If Step 4a found fewer than 2, leave
  the remaining slot(s) as the template's own `[Project-specific anti-pattern]`
  placeholder rather than fabricating a finding.
- Any remaining `[...]` placeholder with no detected or provided value stays as
  a `<!-- TODO: … -->` line rather than silent emptiness.

#### Step 6a: MANDATORY — wire the project's security/threat model into the Decision Framework

If the project has a written threat model (search `docs/security_model/`,
`docs/security*.md`, `SECURITY.md`), the rendered philosophy MUST carry a
Decision Framework row pointing at it — and that row MUST NOT be keyed on the
word "attacker".

```text
| Does this add a GUARD, RETENTION RULE, PERMANENCE/IMMUTABILITY claim,
  AUDIT/FORENSIC requirement, TAMPER-EVIDENCE, or AUTHORIZATION/RECIPIENT
  check — WHETHER OR NOT it names an attacker? | Read <threat-model-path> §1
  BEFORE designing it. State the project's actual deployment shape here. |
```

🔴 **WHY THE KEY MATTERS MORE THAN THE POINTER (thrum, 2026-07-24).** This
project already had a security-model row and it read _"Does this design name an
ATTACKER, or harden against one?"_ — so it **could not fire** on a requirement
that never named one. A permanence requirement arrived framed as _"forensic
evidence must survive"_, read as durability rather than security, and produced
an unratified never-rotate invariant that reached an implementer as a build
instruction. **A control whose key excludes its own target population is
decoration.** Security-shaped requirements usually arrive wearing non-security
vocabulary: durability, forensics, compliance, "defence in depth", "must never
be lost".

🔴 **AND STATE THE DEPLOYMENT SHAPE POSITIVELY, not just the exclusions.** The
dominant failure here is importing a SaaS/multi-tenant frame into a system that
is not one — which **manufactures defects out of correct design** (recorded
twice on this project; one instance invalidated a six-agent inventory). Write
what the project IS, e.g. for thrum: _NOT SaaS, NOT internet-facing, NOT
product-oriented; single-user, localhost, multi-machine on the same network._ A
reader who knows only what is out of scope will still import the wrong frame.

#### Step 7: Write `.thrum/philosophy.md`

`mkdir -p .thrum/` then write the rendered content. Announce the path in the
final message so the user knows where to edit it manually later.

### Re-run-unchanged mode

Triggered when `.thrum/philosophy.md` exists. The goal is a fast,
side-effect-free sanity check that confirms the doc is still accurate for the
current project state.

#### Step 1: Read the existing doc

Read `.thrum/philosophy.md` in full. Parse its sections — at minimum the
language/framework line, the test harness line, and the anti-patterns list.

#### Step 2: Sanity-check against current project state

Walk the same detection steps as first-run, but compare rather than write:

- Language / framework / test harness — do the current manifest files agree with
  what the doc claims?
- Anti-patterns in `CLAUDE.md` (or equivalent) — is every anti-pattern in
  CLAUDE.md reflected in the doc?
- Linters or test configs recently added — are they acknowledged?

Each check is a boolean "matches" vs. "differs". Keep the comparison narrow;
this mode should not do deep inspection.

#### Step 3: If nothing differs — no-op exit

Print:

> `.thrum/philosophy.md` is current; no changes needed.

Do NOT write to the file. Do NOT update mtime. Do NOT create backups. Exit
cleanly.

#### Step 4: If anything differs — hand off to evolved mode

If at least one check reports "differs", transition to the re-run-evolved flow
(below). The drift detection from Step 2 becomes the input to the diff proposal.

Idempotency invariant: re-running `/project-philosophy` on an unchanged project
must never modify any file. Tests for this mode should confirm mtime is
untouched — `stat -c %Y .thrum/philosophy.md` on Linux,
`stat -f %m .thrum/philosophy.md` on macOS.

### Re-run-evolved mode

Triggered when `.thrum/philosophy.md` exists AND the unchanged-mode sanity check
flagged drift. This is the load-bearing idempotency path — philosophy docs
accumulate learned anti-patterns over time, so silent overwrites destroy
context. The merge-proposal shape is the only correct shape.

> **Never silently overwrite.** Philosophy docs are not regenerated — they are
> evolved. If the user has added hand-written anti-patterns, post-mortem
> references, or team-specific notes, those must survive every re-run. A write
> without explicit user confirmation is a bug.

#### Step 1: Read the existing doc

Same as re-run-unchanged Step 1. Keep the parsed sections in memory so the diff
proposal can cite them.

#### Step 2: Detect drift

Four drift categories, conservative on purpose:

- **Language/framework version change.** `go.mod`'s `go 1.X` differs from the
  doc's stated version; `package.json` lists `next@15.x` but doc says
  `next@14.x`.
- **New test patterns in codebase.** `ginkgo` imports appear but the doc lists
  only `stdlib testing`. New `playwright.config.ts` exists but doc doesn't
  mention E2E.
- **New anti-patterns recorded in CLAUDE.md since last run.** Compare
  anti-pattern bullets in CLAUDE.md against the doc's `{{ANTI_PATTERNS}}`
  section; anything new in CLAUDE.md is a drift candidate.
- **New linters or code-quality tooling added.** `.golangci.yml`,
  `eslint.config.js`, `ruff.toml` that weren't mentioned in the doc.

Start conservative. Expand the detector list only based on real-use feedback —
over-eager drift detection pesters users and erodes trust in the skill.

#### Step 3: Compute a proposed diff (sectional)

Present drift as a readable sectional diff, one item per drift category. Each
item should have:

- The detected change in plain language
- A proposed edit (insertion / replacement / addition at the bottom of a
  section)
- A one-line rationale

Example shape:

```markdown
### Proposed updates to `.thrum/philosophy.md`

**1. Framework version bump**

- Current: "Next.js 14"
- Proposed: "Next.js 15"
- Rationale: `package.json` lists `"next": "^15.0.0"`

**2. New anti-pattern from CLAUDE.md**

- Proposed addition under "## Anti-patterns":
  > - Never run migrations from an agent session — always via the release
  >   pipeline.
- Rationale: Added to CLAUDE.md in commit abc1234 after the 2026-03 incident.
```

#### Step 4: Present via `AskUserQuestion`

Use `AskUserQuestion` with:

- A concise summary question: "3 drifts detected against `.thrum/philosophy.md`.
  Apply all, select, or decline?"
- Options: `Apply all`, `Select items to apply`, `Decline (keep doc as-is)`
- Include the full sectional diff from Step 3 in the question context so the
  user can see what they're approving

If the user picks `Select items`, fire a follow-up `AskUserQuestion` with
per-item yes/no choices.

#### Step 5: Write only on confirmation

Apply approved edits in-place. For each applied edit:

- Preserve surrounding content (don't re-render the whole template)
- Append a provenance comment near the change:
  `<!-- updated YYYY-MM-DD via project-philosophy re-run-evolved -->`

Write the file once, at the end. Announce the applied items in the final
message.

#### Step 6: On decline — no write + log

If the user declines (or selects zero items), do NOT write to the file. Record
the skipped proposal in `.thrum/philosophy-skipped.jsonl` (append-only, one JSON
line per decline) with the timestamp and the drift items proposed. Future runs
can re-surface the same items without re-computing drift from scratch.

Skipped-proposal log is advisory — its absence is not an error.

### Reference

- `.thrum/philosophy.md` — the canonical doc this skill generates
- `resources/reliability-class-library.md` — the generalizable reliability class
  library Step 4a probes; shared with `project-hotpath-gate`
- `coordinator-philosophy-merge-gate` — the gate skill that reads the philosophy
  doc
- `project-hotpath-gate` — the companion builder that generates
  `.thrum/hotpath-gate.json` (hot-path/perf gate config). Run both at the same
  onboarding moment so the project has both general philosophy and hot-path gate
  configuration from day one.
