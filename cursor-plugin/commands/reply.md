description: Reply to a message
argument-hint: [msg-id --stdin]
---

Reply to a message with the same audience as the original.

If arguments are provided, use them. Otherwise ask for the message ID and reply
content.

```bash
thrum reply <msg-id> --stdin <<'EOF'
response text
EOF
```

The reply inherits the original message's audience (direct or group).

If the body has backticks, `$(...)`, `$VAR`, or quotes, pass it via a quoted
heredoc so the shell doesn't corrupt it (thrum-d3fp):

```bash
thrum reply <msg-id> --stdin <<'EOF'
Done — see `internal/foo.go`. Cost was $(estimate).
EOF
```

`--body-file <path>` reads from a file; the response argument `-` is a stdin
alias.
