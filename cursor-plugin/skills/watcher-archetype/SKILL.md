# Watcher Archetype: the deterministic run cycle

A watcher is a read-only, scheduled agent that detects issues deterministically,
files/annotates them as beads, and exits. The substrate provides the engine and
the `thrum watcher` CLI; a domain skill-pack supplies the scanner. Your job each
wake is to run ONE cycle and exit — never to fix, never to write code.

## The non-negotiable invariants

1. **Read-only.** Never edit source, never write an in-code marker.
   Markers are implementer-side; you only read them (the scanner does) to
   re-link a finding after a rename.
2. **Wake-run-exit.** One cycle per wake. No resident loop, no polling.
3. **Determinism.** The scanner decides findings; you do not. Your only
   judgment is triage + fix-sketch authoring, both keyed by the stable
   fingerprint so they survive line drift.
4. **Research, don't fix.** You detect and annotate; the implementer fixes.
5. **Fail toward open.** Never close a finding for a unit you didn't
   actually re-scan.

## The loop

```text
┌─ scan ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ thrum watcher scan --id <id>                                          │
│   → JSON: {head_commit, mode, needs_triage[], scan_failures[]}        │
│   read-only: no store writes, no cursor advance                       │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
              │  needs_triage[] = OPEN/REOPEN findings
              ▼
┌─ triage + fix-sketch (your only judgment) ───────────────────────────┐
│ For each finding you understand well enough to suggest a fix, add an  │
│ entry to a fix-sketches JSON file keyed by the finding's fingerprint: │
│   { "<fingerprint>": "<one- or two-line fix sketch>", ... }           │
│ Sketches are advisory text for the implementer — NEVER code, NEVER a  │
│ file edit. Findings you can't sketch still get filed (empty sketch).  │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
              ▼
┌─ emit ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ thrum watcher emit --id <id> [--beads] [--fix-sketches sketches.json] │
│   [--domain <d>] [--priority <p>]                                     │
│   → applies reconciled actions: detection facts to the store and,     │
│     with --beads, files/closes beads. Advances the run cursor.        │
│   → JSON: the run summary {run_id, new, closed, reopened, ...}        │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
              ▼
┌─ report ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ thrum watcher report --id <id>                                        │
│   → writes report.md + report.json to the agent dir (always-on).      │
│   Then PRINT ONE PANE LINE with a UTC timestamp:                      │
│     watcher <id> cycle done <ts> — <N> new, <C> closed, <R> reopened   │
│   The pane line is the verification surface — no digest message.      │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
              ▼
┌─ done ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ thrum job done   → signal completion; the daemon tears you down.      │
│ Then EXIT. Do not start a second cycle.                               │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

An empty run (no `needs_triage`) is still valid: run `emit` (advances the
cursor, records the run), `report`, print the pane line, then `thrum job done`.

Scanner-failure, store-loss, and bd-down surface automatically as
high-priority health-alerts — don't suppress them, nothing else to do.

## Domain skill-pack plug-in contract

A DOMAIN watcher (security, lint, deps, web-routes, …) is built by composing
this archetype skill with a domain skill-pack that supplies the domain's
`enumerate.Enumerator`/`scan.ScannerAdapter` (the deterministic detector,
compiled in at build time) and its triage guidance. Detection logic ALWAYS
lives in the domain's scanner, never in agent prose.

## Config

The watcher's config lives at `.thrum/agents/<id>/` at the repo root
(resolve via `.thrum/redirect` from a worktree) — see the role preamble for
the per-wake read. It runs as a `scheduled_agent` job.
